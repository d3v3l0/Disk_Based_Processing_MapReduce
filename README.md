In Disk Based processing we learn to use various Bigdata tools for example: MapReduce,Yarn.. 

Here are the basic implementations of Mapreduce Programs:
  ## 1. [Word Count Program](https://github.com/priyansh19/Disk_Based_Processing_MapReduce/tree/master/WordCount) :
  
In this program we have tried to count the no. of words in a file(in HDFS) and no of occurences we get will be stored in a seperate file in HDFS < [name of dir mentioned in command]/part* >  
  ## 2. [Word Count Program Using Tool Runner]() :
In this program we will count the no. of words/occuraces of word in a file(in HDFS)and the file we getas output will be stored in HDFS < [name of dir mentioned in command]/part* >
